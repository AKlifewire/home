# Dynamic UI Implementation Checklist

## Backend Components

- [x] Device Config to UI Lambda function
- [x] IoT Rule to trigger Lambda on device config publish
- [x] S3 storage for UI layouts
- [x] IAM permissions for Lambda to access S3

## Device Configuration Format

- [x] Standard JSON format for device capabilities
- [x] Support for device metadata (location, name)
- [x] Support for custom labels
- [x] Feature list with component mapping

## Flutter App Components

- [x] Storage service for S3 access
- [x] Dynamic UI builder widget
- [x] Component builders for different UI elements
- [x] Device screen that uses dynamic UI

## Testing

- [ ] Test device config publishing
- [ ] Verify Lambda processing
- [ ] Check S3 storage of layouts
- [ ] Test Flutter app rendering

## Integration Steps

1. Deploy the AWS infrastructure using CDK
2. Update device firmware to publish config on boot
3. Install the Flutter app on test devices
4. Connect to your IoT devices and verify UI rendering

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Lambda Not Processing Config

- Check IoT Rule SQL statement
- Verify Lambda permissions
- Check CloudWatch logs for errors

### S3 Access Issues

- Verify IAM permissions
- Check Cognito identity pool configuration
- Ensure correct S3 bucket policy

### Flutter App Not Rendering UI

- Check S3 path format
- Verify authentication is working
- Look for errors in app logs
