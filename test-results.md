- Generated proper control topics for MQTT communication
- Created appropriate widget types based on component types

✅ **Sensor Device**: Successfully converted sensor device configuration to UI layout with gauge widgets.
- Set correct min/max values and units for temperature and humidity
- Created appropriate status topics for real-time updates

✅ **Legacy Device Format**: Successfully handled legacy device format with features array.
- Correctly mapped feature names to widget types
- Applied labels from the configuration

### 2. Device Control via MQTT

✅ **Command Sending**: Successfully sent commands to devices via MQTT.
- Properly formatted command payloads with component IDs
- Used correct topics for each device

✅ **Status Updates**: Successfully processed status updates from devices.
- Parsed status messages correctly
- Updated UI components based on status

### 3. Dynamic UI Rendering

✅ **Widget Creation**: Successfully created widgets based on UI component definitions.
- Created appropriate widget types (toggle, gauge, etc.)
- Applied properties from component definitions

✅ **Multi-screen Support**: Successfully handled devices with multiple screens.
- Created tabbed interface for devices with multiple screens
- Rendered widgets in appropriate screens

## Implementation Verification

The implementation successfully demonstrates the core functionality of the Smart Home IoT Platform:

1. **Device Registration**: Devices can register with the platform and provide their capabilities.

2. **Dynamic UI Generation**: The platform can generate UI layouts based on device configurations.

3. **UI Rendering**: The Flutter app can render UI components based on the generated layouts.

4. **Device Control**: Users can control devices through the UI, which sends commands via MQTT.

5. **Real-time Updates**: The UI updates in real-time based on device status changes.

## Next Steps

1. **Complete CDK Stack Implementation**: Finalize the AWS CDK stacks for deployment.

2. **Enhance Error Handling**: Add more robust error handling for edge cases.

3. **Add Authentication Flow**: Complete the authentication flow with Cognito.

4. **Implement Device Management**: Add screens for device management (add, remove, group).

5. **Add Analytics**: Implement analytics for device usage and performance.
